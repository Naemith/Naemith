### Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I'm Romain Vallot ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª

I am currently doing my M.Sc in [Machine Learning and Data Mining](https://mldm.univ-st-etienne.fr/) from [University Jean Monnet](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/fr/index.html), Saint Etienne, France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·. 

In my spare time, I like to go climbing and working on small coding projects, as little video games that you can find on [itch.io](https://minarov.itch.io
).
